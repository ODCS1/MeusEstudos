Key Concepts of Recursion

1 - BASE CASE:

This is the condition under which the recursion stops. ItÂ´s essential to prevent infinite recursion and eventual stack overflow. The base case provides a simple solution for the smallest instance of the problem.


2 - RECURSIVE CASE:

This is the part where the function calls itself with a modified argument, making progress towards the base case.

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF A RECURSIVE FUNCTION:

def recursive_function(parameters):
    if base_case_condition:
        return base_case_value
    else:
        # Recursive call with modified parameters
        return recursive_function(modified_parameters)
